aura/fl_server.py — Flower FL Server: FLTrust Aggregation + Straggler Policy
=============================================================================

This server implements two critical security properties:

1. BYZANTINE ROBUSTNESS (FLTrust Aggregation — Upgrade 6)
   --------------------------------------------------------
   Standard FedAvg is vulnerable to model poisoning. Legacy Krum (distance-based;
   see krum_select / krum_aggregate below) guards geometrically but has a critical flaw: it rejects
   clients whose updates are geometrically distant even if they are
   *honestly* trained on rare or skewed data distributions (e.g., a
   hospital with rare disease traffic).  This causes false-positive
   rejections of legitimate but outlier clients.

   FLTrust (Cao et al., 2020) fixes this:
     - The server holds a small clean root dataset (FLTRUST_ROOT_SAMPLES
       synthetic benign samples).
     - Each round, the server trains one optimisation step on the root
       dataset to obtain a reference gradient direction.
     - Each client update is scored by its cosine similarity with the
       server's gradient direction — ReLU ensures negative similarity
       (i.e., adversarial reversal) maps to zero trust.
     - Client updates are re-scaled to the server update's magnitude
       before weighted aggregation, preventing magnitude-based amplification.

   Key advantage: a hospital client with unusual-but-legitimate data has
   a gradient that still *points in the same direction* as improvement on
   normal traffic. Legacy Krum would drop it; FLTrust keeps it with proportional
   trust.

   **Active aggregation:** FLTrust in aggregate_fit. **Legacy fallback only:**
   krum_select / krum_aggregate (not used in the default path) retained for rollback or experiments.

2. STRAGGLER TIMEOUT POLICY
   --------------------------
   In synchronous FL, if a client disconnects mid-round, the server
   blocks indefinitely — causing a Denial-of-Service against the entire
   federation.

   AURA implements an explicit timeout policy:
     - After `round_timeout_sec` seconds, unreceived client updates
       are DROPPED from the aggregation round.
     - If fewer than `min_clients` responses arrive, the round is
       ABANDONED and the previous global model is preserved.
     - A warning is logged for operator review.

3. IMMUTABLE AUDIT LOG
   ----------------------
   After each successful aggregation, the server hashes the model weights
   (SHA-256) and writes the hash to the AURA blockchain module.
   This creates a tamper-evident chain of custody for all model updates.

    Krum Selection Algorithm (Blanchard et al., 2017).

    Algorithm
    ---------
    Given n client weight updates {w_1, ..., w_n}:
    1. For each client i, flatten its weight update into a 1D vector.
    2. Compute pairwise squared Euclidean distances: d(i,j) = ||w_i - w_j||²
    3. For each client i, compute the Krum score:
         s(i) = Σ_{j ∈ N_k(i)} d(i, j)
       where N_k(i) = k nearest neighbours of i (k = n - num_to_select - 2)
    4. Select the num_to_select clients with the LOWEST Krum scores.

    Poisoned clients produce updates far from the cluster → high scores → dropped.

    Parameters
    ----------
    updates        : List of per-client parameters (each is a list of ndarrays)
    num_to_select  : How many clients to keep (KRUM_NUM_TO_SELECT in config)

    FLTrust Aggregation (Cao et al., 2020).

    Algorithm
    ---------
    1. Compute server reference update:
         Clone the global model, train one step on root_data (benign),
         delta_server = new_params − old_params.
         Flatten to 1-D vector: server_vec.

    2. For each client i:
         delta_i    = client_params_i − global_params
         client_vec = flatten(delta_i)
         trust_i    = ReLU(cosine_similarity(client_vec, server_vec))
         # Positive = update points same direction as benign improvement
         # Negative = adversarial reversal → ReLU ⇒ zero trust, flagged.

    3. Normalise client update magnitude to server update magnitude:
         scale_i = ||server_vec|| / (||client_vec|| + ε)
         normalised_i = scale_i × delta_i

    4. Weighted aggregation:
         new_global = global + Σ(trust_i / Σtrust) × normalised_i

    Parameters
    ----------
    global_model   : The current global AURAModelBundle.
    client_updates : Each element is a list of np.ndarray (Flower format).
    root_data      : [N, F] benign tensor (server's trusted data).
    server_lr      : LR for the one-step server gradient computation.
    min_trust      : Trust scores at or below this are flagged Byzantine.

    Returns
    -------
    (new_arrays, trust_scores, flagged_indices)
      new_arrays    : Aggregated model as list[np.ndarray] (same layout as input)
      trust_scores  : Per-client cosine trust score ∈ [0, 1]
      flagged_indices: Indices of clients with trust ≤ min_trust (Byzantine suspects)
